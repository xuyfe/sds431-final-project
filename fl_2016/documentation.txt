Alabama
-------
Election results from the Alabama Secretary of State Elections Division (https://www.sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data). 

Incorrect or incomplete data was replaced using the county canvass reports for the following counties: Blount, Bullock, Dallas, Escambia, Greene, Hale, Jackson, Jefferson, Lamar, Lawrence, Marion, Pickens, Randolph, Russell, St. Clair, Shelby, Washington, Wilcox.

Absentee and provisional ballots were reported countywide in all counties. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote. Mobile County also reported only countywide totals for write in votes. These were distributed to precincts based on the difference between the number of ballots cast and the total votes reported for named candidates.

Note that the precinct results from DeKalb County add up to a higher total number of votes than the countywide totals certified by the state canvass. At the presidential level the difference is: Clinton (D) 60, Trump (R) 374, Johnson (L) 11, Stein (G) 4, Write In 3.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release, except the following counties use shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Baldwin, Blount, Calhoun, Cullman, DeKalb, Franklin, Jefferson, Lee, Limestone, Madison, Marengo, Marshall, Mobile, Morgan, St. Clair, Shelby, Talladega, Tuscaloosa.

Precinct boundaries were adjusted as appropriate to align with county maps, municipal boundaries, or commission districts. Precinct boundaries throughout the state were further reviewed with the voter registration file in effect for the November 2016 general election. Voting districts in nearly all counties were edited accordingly to align with reporting units in the 2016 election results. In many counties the resulting boundaries bear little resemblance to the 2020 Census VTDs. As these boundary revisions were so extensive only splits and merges are specified below by precinct.

Many precincts have outdated names in the Census VTDs. The Census VTDs also have at least some precinct names in wrong locations for the following counties: Clarke, Clay, Cleburne, Conecuh, Dallas, Escambia, Geneva, Greene, Jefferson, Lauderdale, Limestone, Marion, Marshall, Monroe, Perry, Randolph, Russell, Tallapoosa, Walker, Washington, Wilcox. Moreover, many precinct numbers and consequently the VTD GeoIDs are also incorrect throughout much of the state in the Census shapefiles. All precinct names and numbers have been edited to match the 2016 voter file.

The following splits and merges were made to align voting district boundaries with reporting units in the 2016 election results.

Precinct shapefile from Alaska Division of Elections (http://www.elections.alaska.gov/Core/districtmaps.php)

Early, absentee, and questioned votes are reported at the state house district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the purpose of reporting votes). Overseas federal absentee ballots are reported at the statewide level. These votes are apportioned by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote as weighted according to the number of ballots cast by vote type in each precinct.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the Georgia General Assembly Reapportionment Office (http://www.legis.ga.gov/Joint/reapportionment/en-US/default.aspx)

Fulton County uses shapefiles and maps sourced from the county GIS program. Precincts CH01/CH04B, CP07A/CP07D, SS29A/SS29B, UC031/UC035 were merged to match how voters were registered in the 2016 voter file.

The following precincts were split by congressional district to match the 2016 election results: Avondale High, Glennwood, Wadsworth in Dekalb County; Cates D in Gwinnett County.

Cloudland and Teloga precincts in Chattooga County were split along the ridgeline that marks the boundary between them with the USGS Topographic Contour shapefile.

Three of the four VTDs in Chattahoochee County are comprised of Fort Benning. However, the county only has one polling location for all voters, including residents of Fort Benning that vote within the county. The four Chattahoochee County VTDs have therefore been merged in the shapefile.

In Wilkes County the boundary between Precinct 1 and Precinct 2A was aligned with the voter file.

Election results from Illinois State Board of Elections(https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/ElectionVoteTotals.aspx)

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties used maps sourced from the respective county governments instead: DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Will.

Some counties used the Census Redistricting shapefiles as a starting point, but were corrected using PDF maps to reverse changes made since 2016. These include Champaign, Greene, Hancock, Kane, Knox, LaSalle, Lawrence, Mason, St. Clair, Will, and Winnebago Counties.

Countywide votes were distributed for Coles, Knox, Macon, McDonough, Tazewell. It was just a single vote in each of Knox, Macon, Tazewell; 3 votes in McDonough; and 30 votes in Coles.

The SBOE results do not include Write-In Votes by precinct for 42 counties. For these counties the Write-In Votes by precinct are transcribed from the official county or city canvass reports.

Initial precinct shapefile provided by the Indiana Secretary of State Election Division (https://www.in.gov/sos/elections/). However, many counties featured outdated precinct boundaries mostly related to changes in corporate boundaries. 2016 precinct boundaries were reviewed using GIS maps or shapefiles from each county. As appropriate, precinct boundaries for the following counties were replaced using shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program or from the respective counties. Wherever necessary, boundaries were further edited to align with 2016 corporate boundaries as determined via county parcel records.

Precinct shapefile from IA Secretary of State: https://sos.iowa.gov/shapefiles/

The Iowa Democratic Party did not report individual vote tallies for the 2016 Iowa caucuses. The caucus results are State Delegate Equivalents that represent the number of state convention delegates that the candidates received based on the caucus results. The SDE figures are multiplied by 100 following the standard practice of the Associated Press since precinct-level SDE figures are provided as very small fractions in the actual caucus reports.

The precinct results do not include the state delegates awarded via satellite locations for participants with hardship exceptions or via tele-caucus for voters abroad. The satellite locations awarded 2 state delegates to Hillary Clinton and 1 state delegate to Bernie Sanders. The tele-caucus awarded 1 state delegate to Hillary Clinton and 1 state delegate to Bernie Sanders.

The following precincts were merged to match the 2016 caucus results:

Appanoose: Udell/Union
Black Hawk: Cedar Falls W2P2/Cedar Falls Twp
Des Moines: Burlington 1/Tama, Burlington 8/Concordia
Fremont: Hamburg/Washington, Farragut/Shenandoah1

Election results by township from Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions (https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html)
Election results by ward from municipal reports for Auburn, Augusta, Belfast, Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell, Lewiston, Portland, Saco, Sanford, South Portland, Westbrook.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. Voting District shapefiles were available for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Sagadahoc, Waldo, York. County Subdivision shapefiles were used instead for Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington.

VTDs were merged for Bath, Brunswick, Waterville as statewide votes are not reported by ward. VTDs for Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell were sourced from township ward maps.

Absentee votes were reported at the township level for Auburn, Lewiston, Gorham, Harpswell, Portland, Westbrook, Augusta, Belfast, Sanford, South Portland. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the township vote for each candidate. Military and overseas ballots (UOCAVA) were reported at the state level. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the statewide vote for each candidate.

For Biddeford, Ellsworth, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland Write-In Votes reported at the township level were apportioned to precincts in the same shares that the total vote was split among precincts within the township.

The state reported 987 votes from Portland for Jill Stein (G). The precinct-level votes in the Portland city report add up to 995 total votes for Stein.

Maine includes more than 400 unorganized townships and islands that do not lie within municipal bounds. While some are designated separately, the U.S. Census Bureau combines most of these into larger unorganized territories within each county. Voters in unorganized townships are assigned to nearby incorporated townships. In some cases these votes are reported separately while in others they are combined into the total vote reported from the central voting location. The shapefile has been modified accordingly with boundaries from the Town Boundaries shapefile provided by the Maine Office of GIS. For unorganized territories that are unpopulated or otherwise do not appear to have any registered voters the Census boundaries have been retained unaltered.

A couple cities that cross county lines reported results from each county while the shapefile had a single precinct. These cross-county precincts were split at the county line with results assigned accordingly.

Fenton City - Genesee/Oakland
Richmond City - Macomb/St. Clair

Although Clare City (Clare/Isabella) and Brown City (Lapeer/Sanilac) also cross county lines the results for statewide elections were reported together by Clare County and Sanilac County respectively.

Detroit City reports absentee votes via Absentee Vote Counting Boards. The cross-reference chart of AVCBs to precincts was received from OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-sources-mi) and the AVCB votes were distributed accordingly by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Mississippi
-----------
Election results from the Mississippi Secretary of State (https://www.sos.ms.gov/elections-voting/election-results). Precinct shapefiles initially from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program.

Precinct boundaries were adjusted as appropriate to align with county maps, supervisor districts, or prior versions of the Census VTDs. Precinct boundaries throughout the state were further reviewed with the voter registration file in effect for the November 2016 general election. Voting districts in nearly all counties were edited accordingly to align with reporting units in the 2016 election results. In some counties the resulting boundaries differ substantially from the 2020 Census VTDs. As these boundary revisions were so extensive only splits and merges are specified below by precinct.

Some Mississippi counties name precincts after polling places and therefore change precinct names when polling places change regardless of whether this involves a change in boundaries. Precinct names were edited wherever necessary to match the November 2016 canvass results.

In Kemper County an alphabetic name split of Scooba precinct was reported as separate line items. In Jefferson Davis County Bassfield 31/32 was an alphabetic name split of Bassfield Hwy 42. These were merged in the shapefile.

The following splits and merges were made to align voting district boundaries with reporting units in the 2016 election results.

Attala: Merge Northwest/Aponaug
Claiborne: Split 2A/2B, 4A/4B; Merge 4A/4D
Coahoma: Split Farrell/Sherard
Covington: Split Gilmer/Yawn, Seminary/West Collins
DeSoto: Merge Miller/Olive Branch East
Forrest: Split Lillie Burney/Salvation Army
Grenada: Merge Mt. Nebo/Pleasant Grove

Missouri
--------
Election results from the Missouri Secretary of State via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-mo/tree/master/2016). Absentee, provisional, and mail ballots were reported countywide in nearly every county. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. Monroe County from the 2010 Census VTD release.

Adams, Antelope, Box Butte, Buffalo, Burt, Butler, Cass, Chase, Cherry, Cuming, Custer, Dakota, Dawes, Dawson, Deuel, Dodge, Douglas, Garfield, Hamilton, Harlan, Holt, Kearney, Keith, Keya Paha, Kimball, Lancaster, Lincoln, Madison, Merrick, Morrill, Nemaha, Nuckolls, Otoe, Perkins, Phelps, Platte, Red Willow, Richardson, Saline, Sarpy, Scotts Bluff, Seward, Stanton, Thayer, Valley, and Washington either used a replacement shapefile or, more often, required tweaks based on PDF maps from county election officials or geocoded voter registration files.

Some counties reported one or more classes of votes at the county level. These were distributed by candidate based on the precinct-level reported vote.

Write-In Votes were inconsistently provided by the counties, so they were excluded. Unofficial precinct results from NE Secretary of State used as a cross-reference in places.

New Jersey
----------
Election results primarily from individual county canvass reports via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-nj/). Results from Burlington, Camden, Middlesex, and Warren counties were partly or wholly replaced using the Statement of the Vote from the respective counties.

Precinct shapefile from New Jersey Geographic Information Network (https://njogis-newjersey.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/election-districts-for-new-jersey). Naval Weapons Station Earle in Monmouth County was added as an unassigned district.

All counties except Sussex and Warren report mail votes and provisional votes at the municipal and/or ward level. Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Ocean, and Union further subdivide these vote types by other districts on the same ballot. Camden, Cape May, Essex, Gloucester, Hudson, Monmouth, Morris, Sussex, and Warren report overseas ballots countywide or by congressional district. All votes were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote of the respective reporting unit.

The following modifications to the shapefile were made to reverse changes in precinct boundaries enacted since 2016.

Gloucester: Merge Glassboro 1/13
Hudson: Merge Jersey City Ward E 9/24, 6/25; Realign Union City Ward 9 precincts
Passaic: Merge Pompton Lakes 3/6
Union: Merge Elizabeth City W1 6/9, W2 2/11, W3 10/13, W4 7/10; Adjust Elizabeth City W2 4/7, 6/7, W3 3/6, W6 1/5

New York
--------
Election results primarily from individual county canvass reports as processed by OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-ny/). Results for the following counties in part or in whole directly from county canvass reports: Dutchess, Erie, Nassau, Oneida.

Dutchess, Greene, Ontario, Seneca, and Warren reported some votes at the countywide level. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. Some New York counties only report official write-ins by precinct while placing invalid Write-In Votes with blank or other void ballots so that write-in figures are not directly comparable at the statewide level.

Precinct shapefiles were obtained from the respective county governments for most counties. The following counties instead use shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau's Redistricting Data Program: Chenango, Columbia, Franklin, Genesee, Hamilton, Lewis, Montgomery, Oswego, Otsego, Schenectady, Schuyler, Seneca, St. Lawrence, Wayne, Wyoming. Nearly all of the Census shapefiles were edited to match PDF maps from the respective county boards of elections or the voter file from the New York State Board of Elections.

The Nassau County shapefile includes several dozen unassigned precinct divisions where a distinct ballot style would be required if they had registered voters. The following include registered voters and were merged into adjoining active precincts based on the voter registration file: HE 19049/19065, HE 20012/20093, HE 21087/22108, HE 22066/22702, NH 13016/13701, OB 15093/15703.

The Chemung County shapefile is significantly outdated. Multiple precincts were split, merged, and adjusted in Elmira, Horseheads, and Southport to match PDF maps provided by the county board of elections. The county boundary between Nassau and Suffolk is misaligned in both shapefiles and was edited to match the voter file. Tioga County has a more accurate parcel-based precinct shapefile that was used instead of the shapefile based on BOE descriptions of the precincts. In Orange County, Blooming Grove, Middletown, and Monroe are from the 2014 shapefile. In Sullivan County, Mamakating is from the 2012 shapefile.

Precincts reported on combined line items for the 2020 general election were consolidated in the following counties: Bronx, Cattaraugus, Kings, Monroe, Nassau, New York, Onondaga, Queens, Richmond, Tompkins, Warren.

These additional modifications were made to reflect precinct boundaries as of the 2016 general election:

Albany: Merge Albany 12-4/12-9, Bethlehem 27/31
Allegany: Merge Andover 1/2, Angelica 1/2
Cayuga: Merge Fleming 1/2
Chautauqua: Add Cherry Creek V, Ellery 2V, Hanover 5V, Sherman V; Adjust Jamestown 5-3/6-1
Chenango: Split Oxford 1/2
Delaware: Merge Tompkins 1/2
Erie: Adjust Tonawanda 63/67

North Carolina
--------------
Election results and precinct shapefile from the NC State Board of Elections (https://www.ncsbe.gov/results-data)

North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical "noise" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.

Until the 2016 general election North Carolina also produced another results-sorted data set that assigned votes by Census VTD. Since NC precinct boundaries are now produced using Census blocks and are therefore interchangeable with VTDs the series was discontinued. The statistical "noise" added to the results-sorted data was greater than that added to the precinct-sorted data in some counties and lesser than that added to the precinct-sorted data in other counties.

For the 2016 general election 29 counties reported all votes by precinct in their initial precinct results. These precinct results were therefore used for the following counties.

Alamance, Alexander, Alleghany, Burke, Cherokee, Clay, Cleveland, Craven, Franklin, Graham, Granville, Hoke, Iredell, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Montgomery, Person, Randolph, Rockingham, Rowan, Rutherford, Stanly, Swain, Transylvania, Union, Vance, Warren, Yancey

The results-sorted data had less noise than the precinct-sorted data in following 45 counties.

Beaufort, Brunswick, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Caswell, Catawba*, Cumberland, Currituck, Davidson, Davie, Duplin, Durham*, Forsyth, Greene, Guilford, Halifax*, Harnett, Haywood, Henderson, Hyde, Jackson*, Johnston, Jones, Lee, Lenoir*, Lincoln, Macon, Moore, Nash, New Hanover, Onslow, Pamlico, Pasquotank, Pender, Pitt*, Polk, Richmond, Sampson, Scotland, Stokes*, Surry*, Tyrrell, Wayne, Wilkes, Yadkin

The precinct-sorted data had less noise than the results-sorted data in the following 26 counties.

Anson, Ashe, Avery, Bertie*, Bladen, Caldwell, Camden, Carteret*, Chatham, Chowan, Columbus, Dare, Edgecombe, Gaston, Gates*, Hertford, Martin*, Mecklenburg*, Northampton*, Orange, Perquimans*, Robeson*, Wake, Washington, Watauga, Wilson

In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the results-sorted or precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The results-sorted or  precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate.

For some counties the results-sorted data includes combined precincts are adds unsorted votes to one of the precinct line items. Where the results-sorted data otherwise contained less noise than the precinct-sorted data then the precinct-sorted data was used instead only for these precincts: Buncombe 05.1/56.2/68.1, Catawba 29, Cumberland CC17/CC31, Forsyth 402/403, Guilford G42B, New Hanover W03/W21, Scotland 09/10.

Oregon
------
Election results from the Oregon Secretary of State via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-or/). Results from Polk, Tillamook, Wallowa, and Wasco counties were corrected with the respective county canvass reports.

Precinct shapefiles for the following counties were provided by the respective county governments: Benton, Columbia, Coos, Crook, Curry, Deschutes, Douglas, Harney, Jackson, Josephine, Klamath, Lane, Linn, Malheur, Morrow, Multnomah, Polk, Sherman, Tillamook, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Wasco, Washington, Yamhill.

Precinct shapefiles for the following counties were provided by the Oregon Secretary of State: Clatsop, Hood River, Jefferson, Marion. Several gaps in the Marion County shapefile were assigned based on the Precinct Split Summary Report.

The precinct shapefile for Clackamas County was provided by the Metro Regional Government Data Resource Center.

Precinct boundaries for Grant County and Wheeler County are defined by school district boundaries. Precinct shapefiles were produced to match PDF maps provided by the respective counties using the 2016 Oregon Education Boundaries shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library.

Precinct shapefiles for the following counties were produced based on PDF maps provided by the respective counties: Baker, Gilliam, Lake, Lincoln. Boundaries defined by the PLSS grid were produced with the Oregon Public Land Survey Quarter-Quarter Reference Grid shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. Municipal boundaries were produced from the Oregon Department of Transportion 2016 City Limits shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. Street boundaries were produced from the U.S. Census Bureau census block shapefiles.

PDF maps obtained from Lake County are approximate precinct boundaries drawn on the PLSS grid for county precincts and on the street map for Lakeview city precincts. These boundaries were adjusted to match address range assignments in the Lake County Address Library Report which serves as the legal definition of the precincts according to the Lake County Clerk. Precinct divisions across roads that span multiple rural precincts are generally defined by zip codes. Address ranges were further identified based on the Lake County tax lot parcel viewer.

Rural precinct boundaries in the shapefiles provided by Coos County and Union County were revised to match the updated PLSS cadastral grid in the Oregon GIS Framework obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. 

Municipal precinct boundaries in the following counties were edited to match city limits in effect for the November 2016 general election: Coos, Douglas, Jefferson, Marion, Tillamook, Umatilla, Yamhill.

Precinct numbers in the Columbia County, Josephine County, and Wallowa County shapefiles were edited to match the Oregon Secretary of State voter file.

Pennsylvania
------------
Election results primarily from the Pennsylvania Department of State (https://www.pa.gov/en/agencies/dos/resources/voting-and-elections-resources/voting-and-election-statistics/bulk-election-data.html). Precinct results were corrected or replaced with canvass reports from the following counties: Allegheny, Bradford, Cumberland, Elk, Indiana, Lancaster, Mifflin, Northampton, Northumberland, Pike, Snyder, Somerset, Susquehanna.

Allegheny County reported president-only ballots at the countywide level. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Northampton County reported results for Lower Mt. Bethel Lower Independent and for Palmer Upper Western Nazareth Independent. These are school district splits that were not actually on the ballot for November 2016. Their designated voting machines were instead used to count ballots without regard to the precinct splits. The relevant results were therefore combined for these precincts.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau 2020 Redistricting Data Program. The shapefiles from Delaware County, Washington County, and the City of Pittsburgh are from the respective jurisdictions. Precinct numbers were corrected to match the 2016 voter file in the following locales: Allegheny (Elizabeth, Pittsburgh W12), Blair (Altoona, Greenfield), Bradford (Athens), Greene (Monongahela), Monroe (Smithfield), Montgomery (Hatfield), Northampton (Bethlehem Twp), Perry (Toboyne), Washington (New Eagle, Somerset), York (Fairview).

Precinct boundaries throughout the state were edited to match voter assignments in the PA Department of State voter file from the 2016 election cycle. While some edits reflect official updates to wards or divisions most involve voters incorrectly assigned to voting districts by the counties. As such the VEST shapefile endeavors to reflect the de facto precinct boundaries and these often differ from the official voting district boundaries, in some cases quite drastically. Wherever possible edits were made using census boundaries or alternatively using various boundary shapefiles from the respective counties or the Pennsylvania Spatial Data Access catalog (https://www.pasda.psu.edu/).  

In some areas voter assignments appear so erratic that it is impractical to place all voters within their assigned precinct. These areas were edited so as to place as many voters as possible within their assigned precinct without displacing a greater number from their assigned precinct. Municipal boundaries were retained except where a significant number of voters were misassigned to the wrong municipality. In cases where the odd/even split was incorrectly reversed for precinct boundary streets the official boundary was retained. All such cases involved a near equal number of voters swapped between voting districts.

Inaccurate municipal boundaries in the VTD shapefile were generally realigned only if necessary to reflect voter assignments. Most corrections were made using the Municipality Boundary shapefile from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (https://data-pennshare.opendata.arcgis.com/). In some cases they were instead based on municipal assignments of parcels. Five boroughs that cross county lines are not designated as separate precincts in one of the counties. These were merged with the voting districts where they are assigned in the respective counties: Adamstown (Berks Spring 12), Ashland (Columbia Conyngham), Emlenton (Clarion Richland), Seven Springs (Fayette Saltlick), Tunnelhill (Blair Allegheny 4).

The following precincts were split to reverse changes between the 2016 and 2020 general elections: Armstrong (Cowanshannock East/Sagamore, Ford City 1 N/S, Ford City 2 N/S, Freeport 1/2, Leechburg 1/2, Parks Kepple Hill/N Vandergrift), Cambria (Reade N/S), Clarion (Farmington S/W), Dauphin (Highspire 1/2, Millersburg 1/2, Steelton 2-1/2, 3-1/2), Elk (Horton N/S), Erie (Corry 3/4), Fayette (Masontown 1/2, Springhill 1/2, Washington 1/2), Franklin (Peters 3/4, Montgomery 3/4), Luzerne (Black Creek 1/2, Freeland 1/2, Luzerne 1/2, Newport 2/3), Lycoming (Clinton 1/2), Mercer (Jefferson E/W, Sharpsville 3/4, S Pymatuning 1/2, Springfield E/W), Potter (Sharon N/S), Venango (Cornplanter 1/2, Cranberry 3/4, Rockland 1/2, Sugarcreek 1/4), Washington (Canton 1/3, Donegal 1/3), Westmoreland (Ligonier Boro 1/2), Wyoming (Falls 1/2, Nicholson Boro 1/2).

The following precincts were merged to reverse changes between the 2016 and 2020 general elections: Adams (Reading 1/3), Allegheny (Marshall 5/7), Chester (Valley N 1/2/3), Erie (Millcreek 23/25), Lebanon (Cornwall N/S, Jackson N/W, N Cornwall N/W, S Londonderry M/N, Swatara N/S), Luzerne (Butler 3/4, Fairview 1/2, Rice 1/2, Sugarloaf 1/2/3, Wright 1/3, 2/4), Mifflin (Brown Church Hill/Reedsville), Monroe (Jackson N/S, Smithfield 1/4), Montgomery (Upper Merion Roberts/Town Center), Northampton (Allen N/S), Westmoreland (Murrysville Sardis 1/2), York (W Manheim 1/2/3).

The following municipalities were edited to reverse a general consolidation or reprecincting between the 2016 and 2020 general elections: Cambria (Johnstown, N Cambria, E Taylor), Centre (State College), Dauphin (Swatara), Greene (Dunkard), Luzerne (Dallas Twp, Kingston Boro, Kingston Twp), Lycoming (Williamsport), Mercer (Farrell, Sharon), Northampton (Bethlehem Twp), Philadelphia (W2, W5, W8, W18), Washington (Cecil, N Strabane, S Strabane).

The following revisions were made to the base shapefiles to match the de facto 2016 precinct boundaries consistent with the voter file. Due to the sheer number of edits boundary adjustments are listed at the borough/township level. There may be as many as two dozen individual precincts that were revised within a given municipality.

Precinct shapefile from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release.

Several precincts in Providence were aligned with the city ward shapefile. Newport 2 and Newport 9 were merged to reverse a split that took place after the 2016 election.

Limited ballots were reported by township. Federal ballots were reported by congressional district. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level vote for the given reporting unit.

South Dakota
------------
Election Results from the South Dakota Secretary of State (https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/election-resources/election-history/2016_Election_History.aspx).
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program. Yankton comes from the 2010 Census VTD release. Pennington is sourced from the Rapid City GIS Division.

Precincts in the following cities were edited to align with 2016 corporate boundaries and ward divisions: Aberdeen, Belle Fourche, Brandon, Brookings, Corsica, Custer, Dell Springs, Flandreau, Harrisburg, Hot Springs, Howard, Lemmon, Lennox, Madison, McLaughlin, Milbank, Mitchell, Plankinton, Platte, Rapid City, Redfield, Salem, Sioux Falls, Spearfish, Sturgis, Tea, Vermillion, Watertown, Webster, Wessington Springs, White River, Winner, Yankton

Brookings, Brown, Hughes, Hyde, Potter, Sully, and Yankton use countywide vote centers rather than polling locations by precinct. South Dakota counties with vote centers do not record votes by precinct. For these counties, votes were apportioned to precincts based on their share of the countywide number of ballots cast by voters registered with the party of the respective candidates. When this method was tested with counties that report votes by precinct the great majority of precincts were within 4% of the actual candidate vote shares. However, a scattering of precincts deviated by as much as 12% from the actual vote shares. These precincts were either in city centers or far outlying areas, signifying that registered Democrats in rural precincts are more likely to vote for Republican candidates than registered Democrats in urban precincts.

Lawrence reported absentee votes countywide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

The certified precinct report from Minnehaha County adds up to about 18 more votes per office than the countywide totals recorded in the official state canvass. This was evidently an oversight in which the preliminary vote count from Minnehaha County was not updated before the final state canvass.

The following additional modifications were made to recreate the 2016 precinct boundaries.

Bennett: Merge Martin City
Brown: Adjust 12/16, 21/22 to match county map

Election results from the Tennessee Secretary of State (https://sos.tn.gov/elections/results#2016). Precinct shapefile primarily from the Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury (https://apps.cot.tn.gov/DPAMaps/Redistrict/Counties). Hamilton County replaced with a shapefile from the county GIS department.

Davidson and Wilson reported absentee votes countywide. Robertson, Stewart, Union, and Wilson reported provisional votes countywide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Thirty counties reported early vote write-ins countywide. These were similarly distributed to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported write-in vote.

In Chester County the East Chester and West Chester precincts were split by the Henderson city limits since county and city votes were reported separately for the 2016 general election.

Texas
-----
Election results and precinct shapefile from the Texas Legislative Council (https://data.capitol.texas.gov/). The precinct data files available for download at the TXLC Capitol Data Portal are allocated to Census VTD geography based on Voting Age Population from the 2010 Census. The unallocated precinct results and registration statistics were generously provided by TXLC staff to instead merge with the precinct boundaries.

The shapefile includes unallocated Voter Registration (VR) and Spanish Surname Voter Registration (SSVR) for the November 2016 general election. Any VR data analysis of these unallocated precinct results should utilize this unallocated VR data rather than the VR data allocated by VTD available for download at CDP. SSVR is denoted as a percentile of total VR for each precinct.

Precinct results for the following counties were replaced in whole or in part with county source files or with precinct data provided via the Secretary of State: Angelina, Archer, Armstrong, Baylor, Bosque, Bowie, Brazos, Cameron, Carson, Cass, Childress, Cochran, Cooke, Dawson, Fannin, Fayette, Franklin, Glasscock, Hansford, Hockley, Hood, Houston, Howard, Jasper, Jeff Davis, Jim Wells, Kleberg, Lamb, La Salle, Loving, Mason, Motley, Navarro, Pecos, Rockwall, Sabine, Schleicher, Somervell, Sterling, Terrell, Throckmorton, Trinity, Val Verde. 

In Brazos County the votes assigned to Precinct 51 in the 2016 general election canvass report are the countywide limited ballots. Precinct 51 is a single parcel with no registered voters.

Precinct totals for the counties listed below do not add up to the Secretary of State County Canvass for one or more offices. Most commonly this is due to omission of some ballots counted after election day from either the county precinct reports or from summary results certified to the state. In some cases these involve data entry errors where numbers were transposed, dropped, or added in one or more precincts or in countywide summations. In some cases corrections to the initial precinct results were made after the certification deadline.

Anderson, Andrews, Bexar, Brooks, Coke, Cottle, Deaf Smith, Donley, Ector, Gonzales, Hamilton, Hansford, Hartley, Hemphill, Hill, Hockley, Houston, Jackson, Jasper, Jeff Davis, Kent, Medina, Morris, Motley, Parmer, Potter, Presidio, Shackelford, Sherman, Willacy, Zavala.

Most of the discrepancies are in single digits or low double digits. The exceptions are a 178 vote overreport from Presidio for Donald Trump (R) for U.S President, a 1000 vote overreport from Bexar for Martina Salinas (G) for Railroad Commissioner, and a 64 vote overreport from Deaf Smith for Adam Reposa (G) for Criminal Appeals Judge 2.

Votes reported countywide were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. This includes all early ballots in Blanco, Collingsworth, Crockett, Dawson, Kent, Loving, McMullen, and Trinity. Mail ballots in Armstrong and Childress. Federal and/or limited ballots in Bexar, Brazos, Cass, Jefferson, and Rockwall. Provisional and military ballots in Bowie, Jasper, Sabine, and Val Verde.

Dimmit, Hudspeth, and San Saba did not file precinct reports with the Secretary of State as required by the Texas election code and assert they are unable to locate any precinct results for the 2016 general election. For Dimmit and Hudspeth the countywide summary totals were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the 2020 precinct-level reported vote. San Saba also failed to file a precinct report in 2020 so the countywide summary totals were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the 2018 precinct-level reported vote.

The following counties reported combined results for some precincts. As these specific precincts align with VTD boundaries the combined results were replaced with the VTD allocated precinct results from the TXLC Capitol Data Portal. Any data corrections or distributions noted above were transferred accordingly.

Bowie: 1A/4E, 2B/4D/5A, 2D/4A/4C/5B, 13/30, 24/25
Brooks: 1/2, 3/4, 5/7, 8/9
Dallam: 1/4, 2/8, 3/5/9, 6/7
Freestone: 1/12

Precinct shapefile from Utah Geospatial Resource Center (https://gis.utah.gov/data/political/voter-precincts/).

The shapefile from UGRC features subprecincts, breaking down precincts in cases of district splits. In many counties election results are reported at the subprecinct level, but for counties where results are instead reported at the precinct level subprecincts are merged accordingly.

In Emery County, 25 canvass votes reported at the county level were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Vermont
-------
Election results from the Vermont Secretary of State (https://vtelectionarchive.sec.state.vt.us/)
Precinct shapefile from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program

The Census VTD shapefile features city wards. However, precinct boundaries for state and federal elections are not based on city wards. They are instead defined by legislative districts wherever they cross municipal boundaries. Therefore, city wards were merged in the shapefile and cities or townships were instead split into precincts wherever necessary using the state legislative district shapefile.

Essex 2 and Essex 3 are incorrectly labeled in the Census VTD shapefile. The labels and results are switched consistent with the township voting district map.

Vermont has four unorganized towns whose residents cast votes in neighboring towns. These were distributed back based on voting age population in the 2016 American Community Survey. (Averill-Canaan, Buel's Gore-Huntington, Ferdinand-Brighton, Glastenbury-Shaftsbury.)

Virginia
--------
Election results from Virginia Department of Elections (https://historical.elections.virginia.gov/). Presidential Write-In Votes from the Official Results rather than the Historical Elections Database.

Absentee ballots and provisional votes were reported at the county or city level throughout the state. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

Precinct shapefile primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. A significant number of precincts throughout the state have been replaced with the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release. Virginia election reports sometimes include precinct splits that are obsolete or unused for the given election cycle. These have been omitted. In cases where voters were assigned to the wrong district the de facto precinct split has been included for that election.

The borders of Chesapeake, Goochland, Hanover, Henrico, Louisa, Norfolk, Petersburg, Prince George, Suffolk, Virginia Beach reflect de facto misalignments that were not corrected before 2016.

The following modifications were made to recreate the 2016 precinct boundaries.

West Virginia
-------------
Election results from the West Virginia Secretary of State (https://sos.wv.gov/elections/Pages/HistElecResults.aspx). The following counties instead use county canvass reports in whole or in part: Cabell, Doddridge, Jackson, Kanawha, Marion, Marshall, Nicholas, Webster, Wyoming. The certified results from Webster County differ by low single digits from the countywide totals reported on the state election results website. 

Precinct shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program unless otherwise specified.

The following use shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments: Barbour, Berkeley, Brooke, Calhoun, Clay, Fayette, Grant, Hancock, Harrison, Jefferson, Kanawha, Marion, Marshall, Mason, Mineral, Monongalia, Monroe, Morgan, Ohio, Pocahontas, Preston, Randolph, Raleigh, Summers, Taylor, Upshur, Wayne, Wood.

The following use shapefiles provided by the West Virginia GIS Technical Center (https://wvgis.wvu.edu/index.php): Boone, Hampshire, Lewis, McDowell, Mercer, Mingo, Putnam, Roane, Wyoming.

Precinct boundaries were adjusted as appropriate to align with county maps, election districts, or municipal wards. Precinct boundaries throughout the state were further reviewed with the voter registration file in effect for the November 2016 general election. Voting districts in nearly all counties were edited accordingly to align with reporting units in the 2016 election results. In many counties the resulting boundaries differ substantially from the 2020 Census VTDs. As these boundary revisions were so extensive only splits and merges are specified below by precinct.

In certain areas voter assignments appear so interspersed that it is impractical to place all voters within their assigned precinct. These areas were edited so as to place as many voters as possible within their assigned precinct without displacing a greater number from their assigned precinct. In McDowell County precincts 84/85, 102/103, 107/109 have such a great degree of overlap in voter assignments that they may be better combined for some statistical data purposes. The boundaries were determined based on how the majority of residents were assigned on each street range.

Election results from the following counties include "alpha" precincts in which voters within the same geographic boundaries are assigned to separate precincts by the first letter of their surname: Cabell, Jefferson, Kanawha, Mingo, Monongalia, Nicholas, Pendleton, Putnam, Wood. These are signified in precinct results with an A/B or 1/2 designation except in Kanawha County where precincts 202/203 are an alpha split of geographic precinct 203 and in Wood County where 62/62A are an alpha split signified in the same manner as geographic subprecincts.

In Jackson County all precincts were renumbered to match county maps. A scattering of precincts across the state were also renumbered to match the voter file.

The following splits and merges were made to align voting district boundaries with reporting units in the November 2016 general election results.

Barbour: Split 11/16/15, 13/14
Cabell: Merge 7/7-2, 34-2/54; Split 11/15
Fayette: Split 23/24, 28/37
Grant: Split 1/3
Kanawha: Split 117A/123, 160A/163, 175A/178, 277A/279, 403A/404

Wisconsin
---------
Election results from the Wisconsin Elections Commission (https://elections.wi.gov/elections/election-results). Precinct shapefile from the Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau (https://gis-ltsb.hub.arcgis.com/).

Wisconsin election results frequently combine multiple wards within a given reporting unit. Election results were disaggregated from reporting units to individual wards proportional to the total number of registered voters within the constituent wards in the subsequent ward-level registration report.

LTSB collects ward boundaries in January and July of each year. However, voting ward boundaries continue to change until a few weeks before the general election due to annexations, incorporations, and other boundary agreements. Ward boundaries were therefore edited wherever necessary to coincide with the 2016 general election based on a comprehensive review of relevant ordinances in the Wisconsin Department of Administration Municipal Data System. A scattering of ward numbers across the state were also edited to match the 2016 voter registration file.

The baseline shapefile for Iron County is from the 2023 LTSB municipal wards shapefile.

The baseline shapefiles for the following counties are from the 2020 LTSB municipal wards shapefile: Ashland, Bayfield, Buffalo, Clark, Crawford, Grant, Green, Jackson, Jefferson, Lafayette, Milwaukee, Pepin, Pierce, Racine, Richland, Sawyer, Vernon, Walworth.

The baseline shapefiles for the following counties are from the 2018 LTSB municipal wards shapefile: Adams, Kewaunee, Langlade, Marquette, Polk, Trempealeau.
